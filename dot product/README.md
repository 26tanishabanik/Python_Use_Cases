## Dot Product of two vectors 
#### Dot Product/Scalar Product : It is an algebraic operation that takes two vectors of equal length and returns a single number as the product.

#### In python dot product can be calculated using 2 methods

##### Method 1: Simple Multiplication 
##### Method 2: Using Numpy library

##### Note: For implementing Method 2, we need to import numpy.
#### If numpy is not installed then install it using pip.
* `pip install numpy`
#### Or you can also install it using conda
* Best practice, use an environment rather than install in the base env
    * `conda create -n my-env`
    * `conda activate my-env`

* If you want to install from conda-forge
  * `conda config --env --add channels conda-forge`

* The actual install command
  * `conda install numpy `
